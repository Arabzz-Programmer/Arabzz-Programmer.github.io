That was my first Allegro 4 Project, I tried to "remake" the original Super Mario Bros. from NES, it has 7/8 versions, going to DEV 1.0 to the latest one, I don't think it is bad for my first project but it is very cool, I recomend you to test. It has 2 levels and it is not finished, I think when I release newer updates I will fix that, don't worry, I don't gived up that project.</div>
