  <div class="Items">
That was my first Allegro 4 Project, I tried to "remake" the original Super Mario Bros. from NES, it has 7/8 versions, going to DEV 1.0 to the latest one, I don't think it is bad for my first project but it is very cool, I recomend you to test. It has 2 levels and it is not finished, I think when I release newer updates I will fix that, don't worry, I don't gived up that project.</div>

  <div class="Items">
Firstly of anything, don't run this on your Computer, I did this ADWare just to test my programming skills, I think it is good, I will do not update this but if you want, test on a VM! It does a fake 0xb00007 error message and waits 10 minutes to make some effects... the messages are random, and I think it does his objective, the ADWare by itself its harmless, but the links that it gives can be malware, so be attent!</div>
